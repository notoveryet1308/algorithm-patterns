## TWO POINTER PATTERN

> Two pointer patterns uses two pointers to iterate over an array or list until the conditions
of the problem is satisfied. This is useful because it allows us to keep track of the values of two different indexes in a single iteration.

####  Whenever there's requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, the two pointer patterns should be the strategy to come to mind.

Pointers can be used to iterate the data structure in one direction or both, depending on the problem statement.

Eg. 
- Palindrome problem
- Reverse an array problem
